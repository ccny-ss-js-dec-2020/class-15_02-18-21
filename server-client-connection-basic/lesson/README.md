## Basic Server to Client Connection
1. Starting with the package.json, instead of starting our application using 'node server.js', we are merely going to run 'npm start' from the top level directory in our terminal. The top level directory being our 'lesson' directory.
2. Once the app is running, put 'http://localhost:3000' into your browser and there is the home page of your app. In the routes.js we set the '/' route to connect to the index.html which is showing at 'http://localhost:3000'. This is us saying that we want our home page to be that index.html page, and 'http://localhost:3000' represents our home page.
